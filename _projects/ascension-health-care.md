Client - Ascension Health Care

The Challenge

Ascension Health Care is a direct subsidiary of Ascension, the largest non-profit health system in the United States and the world's largest Catholic health system, with headquarters in Edmunson, Missouri (near St. Lous).  The system has 131 hospitals with an assortment of Nortel, Avaya, and Siemens PBXs and is in various stages of implementing Cisco Call Manager VoIP systems at selected locations/sites.    Management needed accurate, HIPA-compliant reporting, and was particularly interested in long term Traffic Analysis and the impact of CUCM configurations on call flow.

The Solution

The Apogee Enterprise platform with its robust multi-site configurations was tested by the Ascension implementation team and proved to be an excellent solution for their demanding requirements.  The continuity of the system interface over all elements in the configuration and the accuracy of the Cisco Tracking clinched the deal.

The Results

Additional locations are continually being added to the expanding system.  The Email-Merge cabability has reduced the maintenance of template creation and modifications to less than an hour, compared to dozens of hours with competitive systems.  The Traffic Analysis results have proven to be extremely beneficial in the analysis or ROI for configuration changes.  Reporting modules with Doctor’s Answering Service features have facilitated tracking and bill-back for services.
