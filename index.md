# SDT Inc.

Strategic Data and Telecom, Inc. (SDT, Inc.) develops and markets innovative telecommunication record management and call accounting solutions designed to deliver critical telecom information that is essential for the effective business operations. Founded in 1980, SDT has been dedicated to remain at the forefront of the computer-telephony revolution and offer reliable, cost-effective, innovative, management reporting solutions that can be tailored to the demands of an ever-changing marketplace.

# Call Accounting Products

Our cutting edge call accounting products have been recognized and adapted by regional RBOCs, equipment manufacturers, and are even licensed by a variety of our well-recognized telecommunication management competitors.  Our re-sellers and channel partners have implemented SDT solutions for a large variety of Fortune 1000 customers.

# Cisco Unified Communication Manager Reporting Solution

SDT was an active participant in early CTI efforts to incorporate CDR (call detail records) information from a variety of sources to generate vital call processing information. Our Cisco Unified Communication Manager Reporting Solution  was introduced in early 2000 to fill the gap between legacy PBX SMDR reporting and the more demanding requirements of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Early adopters of CUCM needed a tracking system that could span the divide between the old and new paradigms.

## **BIG DATA**

The next decade brought another cataclysmic shift with an avalanche of business data generated from all aspects of everyday corporate activities. Datacentric models began to be developed to obtain an understanding of this disparate data and it was clear that CUCM data and other VoIP data from devices such as SBC controllers were becoming increasingly important components of these models. SDT recognized this shift in emphasis from management reporting to **Data Modeling and Analytics** and has incorporated an arsenal of Business Integration Tools into a core tele-management product based upon a 35–year-track-record and thousands of terabytes of call records successfully recorded and processed.

## WHAT WE OFFER
